      <h5>About Me</h5>
      <p>Hello! My name is Andrea Nave. Some brief insights and background about me. I am 90% German, so I have a spot
        on,
        rediculiusly strong work ethic, it’s in my blood. Although, my heart and stomach says I am an 80-year-old
        Italian
        woman. I could live on coffee, Neapolitan style pizzas, fresh bread and Parmesean cheese for the rest of my life
        and
        be happy. I am currently in love with everything farmhouse design and Boho Chic.

        I’m a self taught plant enthusiast. I love plants. I used to kill them all, but I have grown to develop an
        appreciation for them and when you sit back and do your research, it is amazing what you can accomplish and
        watch
        grow and evolve.

        I would say I have a very unique style and gifted perspective to see things differently. I can read people well
        and
        tend to know what they want. I believe simple is better.

        I started my career as a visual designer and learned everything that comes with making things look pretty.
        Further
        evolving in my career, I have found myself in roles as a marketing coordinator, creative director, freelance
        designer, social media specialist and UX/UI designer. Over the years my passion has grown for UX/UI. I believe
        it is
        so important for companies and individuals to have targeted, researched, usable design for their products and I
        love
        the art of creating successful design solutions.</p>
